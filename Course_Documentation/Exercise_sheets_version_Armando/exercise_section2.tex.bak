\section{Exercise two: 2D data}
You will find the formulas required for the range and azimuth chirp rates in the tutorial on epsilon nought (http://epsilon.nought.de/).

\subsection{2D Chirp (point target)}
Use the information in the file \textit{chirp\_2d\_test\_constants.txt} and \textit{chirp\_2d\_test.dat} to focus (or compress) a 2-D chirp.
.DAT format: two longs (range and azimuth dimensions) followed by complex values
(IDL functions that may help: openr, readu, close, free\_lun, lonarr, complexarr, shade\_surf)

\subsubsection{compress 2D pulse}
\subsubsection{compress 2D pulse with Hamming in azimuth}
\subsubsection{compress 2D pulse with two-looks in azimuth}
Literature: \textit{Chapter 2.2 in the "Scientific SAR User's Guide" by Coert Olmsted}.

\subsection{2D image from raw format}
Use the information in the file \textit{ers\_constants.txt} and \textit{ers\_raw\_demo.dat} to focus (or compress) a 2-D chirp. Note, that the image is negativly chirped ($Bw = -1.55404d7$)
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot data after range compression
\item Plot data after azimuth compression
\item Plot data after azimuth compression with Hamming in azimtuh
\end{itemize}
(tip: you might want to scale the amplitudes after Hamming to conserve power)
(IDL functions that may help: tv, bytscl, congrid, hanning)\\
Literature: \textit{Chapter 3.1 in the "Scientific SAR User's Guide" by Coert Olmsted}.


\subsection{2D image from range compressed format}
Use the information in the file \textit{rdemo040689\_cmp\_constants.txt} and \textit{rdemo040689\_cmp.dat} to focus (or compress) a 2-D chirp.
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot data after azimuth compression (data ALREADY range compressed)
\item Plot data after azimuth compression AND Hamming
\end{itemize}
